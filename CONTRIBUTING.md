OBS.: This document is still under construction.

## Issues

Contributions should be first be opened as [issues](https://github.com/larocs/EMG-GAN/issues). So, before openning a pull request with contribution, please be sure there is an open issue demanding it.

### Issues should be opened for: 
* **Requesting new features or enhancements.** Consider asking for new characteristics, funcionalities, or enhancements in the framework. Features considered unfeasible, inappropriate, or violating the principles of the EMG-GAN project will be closed. 
* **Bug fixes.** Did you experience any bug that you cannot or do not know how to fix. Please, be sure it is a framework problem and open an issue.
* **Requesting additional documentation.** documentation is hard to keep up-to-date. So keep it in mind before asking for new documentation effort. If you believe a documentation is essential, please open a issue describing exactly what is to be document and the motivation for that.

### Labels
Please, do not use customized labels to show your intentions. 
Use the default set of labels available in Github.
